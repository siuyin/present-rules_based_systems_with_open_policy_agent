## Complex Rules-based Systems

Think about the eligibility criteria for buying a
Singapore Housing Development Board flat.

## Traditional Systems

input ⇨ system ⇨ output

- input is some form of structured document, typically json or yaml.
- system:
  - converts input to an internal data structure
  - uses a series of `if` statements to determine output

The challenge is managing the complex web of if-then-else statements.
Think about the `if` statements to implement the citizenship criteria rule:

- At least 1 Singapore Citizen applicant
- At least 1 other Singapore Citizen or Singapore Permanent Resident (Conditions attached)

## OPA's rego language if structure is different

Traditional `if` structure:

```
if (method == "GET" && url != "secret") ||
   (method == "POST" && url == "newcustomer") {
  return allow
}
return !allow
```

OPA's `if` structure:

```
default allow = false
allow {
  method == "GET"
  url != "secret"
}

allow {
  method == "POST"
  url == "newcustomer"
}
```

All expressions within an `allow` rule must evaluate to `true` for rule to be true.
Otherwise the rule is undefined and falls back to a default value if a default is declared.

## OPA rules can return many types

An OPA rule can return a boolean, string, number, json array or  json object.

```
grant = {
  "status":"approved -- needy", "amount": 100
  } {
    income < 10
}
grant = {
  "status":"approved -- very needy", "amount": 200
  } {
    income < 5
}
grant = {
  "status":"denied", "amount": 0
  } {
    income >= 10
}
```

The above `grant` rule value is assigned the appropriate json object depending on the income input.

## OPA rules can scan the input document

hdb_criteria.rego:

.code scan_example/hdb_criteria.rego

hdb_application.yaml:

.code scan_example/hdb_application.yaml

OPA evaluation run
```
cd scan_example
opa eval --input hdb_application.yaml --data hdb_criteria.rego --format pretty data.hdb
```

## Explaining `input` and `data`

input ⇨ system ⇨ output

OPA assignes the input yaml or json document to an internal global variable named `input`.

The OPA system contains policies (.rego files), internal data (.json or yaml files)
and optionally external data connections (eg. to databases).

These policies and data are assigned to an internal global variable named `data`.

Thus for: 
```
opa eval --input hdb_application.yaml --data hdb_criteria.rego --format pretty data.hdb
```

- hdb_application.yaml is decoded to an internal object named `input`
- hdb_criteria.rego is loaded into the OPA system and named `data`
- `--format pretty`, pretty prints the output
- `data.hdb` is the query

## Packages

.code scan_example/hdb_criteria.rego

OPA policies belong to named packages like `package hdb` or `package hdb.new_flat.keys`.

Thus the `data.hdb` query in:
```
opa eval --input hdb_application.yaml --data hdb_criteria.rego --format pretty data.hdb
```
means "tell me about policy decisions made in the hdb package".

And OPA outputs:
```
{
  "at_least_one_citizen": true
}

```

## The meaning of _ 

.code scan_example/hdb_criteria.rego

The above reads:
- if `at_least_one_citizen` is undefined, give it the default value `false`.
- `at_least_one_citizen` is true if there is some input applicants[ i ] whose resident_status is "citizen".

## input.applicants[ _ ]

.code scan_example/hdb_application.yaml

In the above case:
- applicants[0] ⇨ "pr"
- applicants[1] ⇨ "citizen"
- applicants[2] ⇨ "other"

## At least two Singapore Citizens or a Citizen and a PR

.code two_example/hdb_criteria.rego

The above reads: For some i and j where i is not equal to j ....

## Testing policies

.code two_example/hdb_criteria_test.rego

## Running the test

The previous test code is in hdb_criteria_test.rego. We run it thus: 

```
cd two_example
opa test . --verbose
```

And the results:
```
data.hdb.test_at_least_two_citizens_or_a_citizen_and_a_pr: PASS (918.925µs)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PASS: 1/1

```

Now let's change the test fixture to cause a failure to see how OPA test reports
a failure.

## Deployment

Open Policy Agent can be deployed:
- as a standalone binary with no other dependencies.
  This is how I have been running OPA in this talk.
- as a sidecar container in a kubernetes pod.
- as a docker container in some containerized environment.
- as a library linked into a `Go` program.

The usual way to interact with OPA is via http/json calls
to the OPA process. This makes OPA language-independent with the
only constraint being the communications speak json.

I plan to give a follow-up talk on using functions written in
OPA's policy language `rego`.

Stay tuned.
